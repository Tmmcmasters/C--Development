EXERCISE 4-5:

Account numbers sometimes contain a check digit that is the result of a mathematical calculation. The inclusion of the digit in an account number helps ascertain whether the number is a valid one.

Write an application named CheckDigit that asks a user to enter a four-digit account number and determines whether it is a valid number.

The number is valid if the fourth digit is the remainder when the number represented by the first three digits of the four-digit number is divided by 7. For example, 7770 is valid, because 0 is the remainder when 777 is divided by 7.

If the account number is valid, output The account number is valid. If the account number is invalid output Invalid. If the account number is too short or too long output Account number invalid - it must have 4 digits.

EXERCISE 4-5:

Write a program named CheckMonth that prompts a user to enter a birth month.

If the value entered is greater than 12 or less than 1, display the error message Invalid month; otherwise, display the valid month with a message such as 3 is a valid month.

EXERCISE 5-6:

Write an application named DisplayMultiplicationTable that displays a table of the products of every combination of two integers from 1 through 10. Your output should resemble the figure below.

EXERCISE 5-7:

Write an application named MultiplicationTable that prompts the user for an integer value, for example 7. Then display the product of every integer from 1 through 10 when multiplied by the entered value. For example, the first three lines of the table might read 1 x 7 = 7, 2 x 7 = 14, and 3 x 7 = 21.
