Standards for Acceptable Software Development are:

Consistent and meaningful variable names,
Consistent spacing and indentation for code readability, 
Abundant but appropriate internal documentation (comments), 
Testing against an appropriate set of test data and other performance criteria
Always keep these standards in mind. You're not just coders, you are developers.

Variable names:  in addition to information in your text, you can search online for terms like camelCase, Hungarian notation, etc. to learn about some common conventions.  In the 'real world' any organization you work with will have it's own standards; for our course (unless your instructor has more specific requirements) you simply need to have a consistent approach.  For example, you can use meaningful multiword names with the first word in lowercase, and the remaining words capitalized - so that totalHotDogs would be your variable name for the integer value that holds the total number of hot dogs sold, or finalBill would be the real number value holding the final amount owed.  You won't call them just X and Y, or intentionally misleading names like hamburgersAreFun or lifeIsAHighway.

This is the programming part of your midterm exam.  It consists of a programming assignment that you will complete using C# in the VS 2019 Community IDE. 

Watch the following video and build the application in Visual Studio 2019 Community.

This part of your midterm exam is worth 50 points, and will be graded - as all programming assignments are graded - based on the Standards for Acceptable Software Development.  You may use your course materials.

Please name the project MidtermPart2.  You'll submit a single word document for grading and a .zip file of the project folder.  Make sure that your .zip file includes the solution file.  This is the file that has the file extension of .sln. Note: you must zip the highest level Project Folder to be able to include the .sln file in the zip file.

Submit:

A word document containing a copy of your source code, screen shots of the GUI design, and successful test runs of the working application. The name of your Word document should be MidtermPart2.docx. 
A zip file of your project which includes the .sln file.
These are the only two file types acceptable for submission.
