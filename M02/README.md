EXERCISE 2-2:

Write a C# program named InchesToCentimeters that declares a named constant that holds the number of centimeters in an inch: 2.54. Also declare a variable to represent a measurement in inches, and assign a value.

Display the measurement in both inches and centimetersâ€”for example, if inches is set to 3, the output should be: 3 inches is 7.62 centimeters.

Note: For final submission, set the number of inches equal to 3.

EXERCISE 2-12:

Write a program named FahrenheitToCelsius that accepts a temperature in Fahrenheit from a user and converts it to Celsius by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit value and multiplying the result by the double 5.0/9.0.

Display both values to one decimal place.

For example, if 88.5 degrees is input, the output would be: 88.5 F is 31.4 C
