Project
This project is a materials list estimator that lets you input items, unit price, quantity, category, and then select or add a category to these itmes. It will generate the total estimated value from said items, input price and quantity for each row. It will also allow you to enter a budget for each category of all of the items. Finally, if you hit calculate, it will generate a pie graph for all of the categories and then highlight any items that were over budget. Below you will find images of how this GUI Application works.
